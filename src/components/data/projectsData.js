Finally, you can use Stripe for checkout. The server api was set up
using Nodejs and Express to fetch data from a MongoDB database and perform CRUD operations. React and styled-components were used to create the front end. JWT was 
incorporated to secure payloads and verify users. Finally, Redux Toolkit was implemented to store the user's state and cart. Deployed on a private VPS using Nginx.`;
